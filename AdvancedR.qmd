## Basics

To start up with, you should be doing the [R_Programming_E](https://github.com/swirldev/R_Programming_E) course using swirl().
You can say that you want to tell me what you did at the end, sending me a message at [elias.bouacida@univ-paris8.fr](mailto:elias.bouacida@univ-paris8.fr).

This should give you the basics to move around R.

## RMarkdown

The second important part of the learning is to learn how to use Rmarkdown to produce nice reports.
There are many great resources to do so. 
The most comprehensive is the [Rmarkdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/).
I ask you to send me the exercises in this  [page](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html).

## ggplot2

You also need to learn how to plot data with R, using the ggplot2 package.
